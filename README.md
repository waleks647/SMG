# Info
SimpleMaterialGenerators (SMG for short) is a Slimefun4 addon that helps aliviate some of the grind by providing simple generators that create simple materials.<br>

## What it adds
Currently it adds generators for:<br>
Cobblestone, Stone, Smooth stone, Gravel, Sand, Glass, Netherrack and Soul sand<br>

## Using the generators
The generators by themselves will do nothing - at least not until they have a chest (directly) above them.<br>
(There's a multiblock example in the SMG category).<br>
Then they will start producing items.<br>
The `Rate` of their production is measured in Slimefun `Ticks`.<br>

## Downloads
You can find the prebuilt plugin in:<br>
https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/waleks647/SMG/master<br>

## Plans
There are plans to add more generators in the future (once I figure out how to do it)<br>
Namely generators for Dirt, Water, Lava, Obsidian and dusts.<br>
